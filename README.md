Sheldog is an initiative to create a community where animals are treated with love and respect, and find the right homes for them to lead comfortable lives. We understand the miserable plight of dogs left astray, prone to various diseases and trauma, and this is a step towards making their life better. Homeless animals can be donated and provided with foster care at our well facilitated centres, volunteered regularly by animal lovers and enthusiasts from all across the place. The animals we receive are checked on regularly by vets, and we ensure they lead a healthy lifestyle and are properly vaccinated. Our facility provides option for adoption, where you can find the fur ball of love well suited to your likes, and shower them with the affection and care that they deserve.

We create profiles for pets for you to conveniently browse through and take your pick and facilitate to make the adoption process hassle free.
